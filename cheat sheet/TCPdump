Letâ€™s start with a basic command that will get us HTTPS traffic:
tcpdump -nnSX port 443
Everything on an interface
tcpdump -i eth0
Find Traffic by IP
tcpdump host 1.1.1.1
Filtering by Source and/or Destination
tcpdump src 1.1.1.1
tcpdump dst 1.0.0.1
Show Traffic Related to a Specific Port
tcpdump port 3389
tcpdump src port 1025
Show Traffic of One Protocol
tcpdump icmp
Reading / Writing Captures to a File (pcap)
tcpdump port 80 -w capture_file
Is packet sniffing possible? What can be seen? Listen to live traffic
tcpdump tcp dst 192.168.1.7 80 and tcp dst 10.5.5.252 21
Note: tcpdump tcp dst [ip] [port] and tcp dst [ip] [port]
